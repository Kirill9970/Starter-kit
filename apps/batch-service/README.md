## Overview

Batch Service is responsible for handling batch operations and background tasks in the microservices architecture. Built with NestJS, it provides efficient processing of large-scale operations and scheduled tasks. The service solves the problem of bulk data insertion into the database by executing multiple operations in a single query, minimizing database load and improving overall performance.

## Features

- ðŸ“¦ Batch Processing
  - Bulk operations
  - Queue management
  - Task scheduling
- ðŸ”„ Background Jobs
  - Async task processing
  - Job prioritization
  - Transaction management
- ðŸ“Š Monitoring
  - Job status tracking
  - Performance metrics
  - Operation status notifications
- ðŸ›  Utilities
  - Error handling
  - Retry mechanisms
  - Batch operation splitting

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- pnpm
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- RabbitMQ

## Installation

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the service root directory with the following configuration:

```env
# Environment
NODE_ENV=local

# Encryption key
API_KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://:password@localhost:6379/0

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_NAME=batch_service_db
DB_USERNAME=app_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_PORT=5433

# RabbitMQ Configuration
BATCH_SERVICE_RMQ_URL=amqp://@localhost:5672
BATCH_SERVICE_RMQ_QUEUE=batch_service

# Batch Processing Settings
BATCH_PROCESS_OPERATION_INTERVAL=5000
BATCH_PROCESS_OPERATION_LIMIT=1000

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Running the Application

### Using Docker

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

### Local Development

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run start

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

## Project Structure

```

## How It Works

### Operation Collection

- The service retrieves records from the `BatchOperations` table at intervals specified by `BATCH_PROCESS_OPERATION_INTERVAL`
- The number of operations processed is limited by `BATCH_PROCESS_OPERATION_LIMIT`

### SQL Query Execution

- Forms a single SQL query that executes within a transaction
- Falls back to individual operation execution if the batch query fails

### Status Notification

- Sends notifications to other services upon completion of batch operations

## Service Integration

### Available Methods

1. `createOperation(request: ICreateBatchOperationRequest): Promise<ICreateBatchOperationResponse>`

   - Adds a new operation to the Batch Service queue
   - Creates a new record in the `BatchOperations` table for processing in the next batch

2. `getOperation(request: IGetBatchOperationRequest): Promise<IGetBatchOperationResponse>`
   - Retrieves an operation from the database by its identifier
   - Returns the operation with the specified `id`

## API Documentation

The service exposes its API documentation through Swagger. Once running, you can access it at:

```

```

## Testing

```bash
# unit tests
$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests
$ pnpm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ pnpm run test:cov
```
